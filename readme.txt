DATA FORMATTING STANDARDS

While there are many pre-processing pipelines used within the lab, the code in this repository makes several assumptions.


1) All analyses are done on files formatted in the FMAToolbox standard 
	- *.clu
	- *.res
	- *.fet 
	- *.spk
	- *.lfp
	- *.pos
2) All variables are formatted in the FMAToolbox standard

4)
